# Thermal Properties of Rock Core Samples from Aso Volcano

This repository provides thermal property data of rock core samples from Aso Volcano, Japan. The dataset includes measurements under both saturated and dried conditions. Key parameters include:

- Thermal conductivity (W/m·K)
- Thermal diffusivity (mm²/s)
- Specific heat capacity (kJ/kg·K and MJ/m³·K)
- Porosity (%)
- P-wave and S-wave velocities (Vp, Vs)
- Elastic properties: Poisson’s ratio, shear modulus, Young’s modulus (for saturated samples)

This dataset forms the basis of the analysis presented in the following publication.
